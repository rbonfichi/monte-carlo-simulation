Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful statistical tool that can be extensively applied in the pharmaceutical and chemical-pharmaceutical industry to address various challenges associated with Quality Assurance (QA), Quality Control (QC), andPproduction processes. This technique, which involves generating random samples to model uncertainty in the input variables of a process or system, can help in making informed decisions, optimizing processes, and ensuring product quality and compliance with regulatory standards. Here are some simple practical applications of Monte Carlo simulation in these areas.
