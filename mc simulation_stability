# Stability Analysis

# A pharmaceutical company needs to predict the shelf life of a new drug stored 
# at various conditions.

# Example:

# The degradation rate of the drug follows a first-order kinetics model, with the
# rate constant k increasing with temperature and humidity.
# Temperature: Normal distribution, mean = 25°C, SD = 5°C.
# Humidity: Normal distribution, mean = 60%, SD = 10%.
# Simulating degradation over 12 months, the company can estimate the probability
# of the drug maintaining at least 90% of its original potency under different 
# storage conditions.
# The simulation might predict a 95% confidence shelf life of 24 months at 
# 25°C/60% RH, aiding in labeling and packaging decisions.

# Number of simulations
n_simulations <- 10000

# Generating random samples for temperature and humidity
temperatures <- rnorm(n_simulations, mean = 25, sd = 2) # °C
humidity <- rnorm(n_simulations, mean = 60, sd = 5) # %

hist(temperatures)
hist(humidity)


# Model parameters (hypothetical values for illustration)
k0 <- 0.1 # Baseline rate constant per month at reference conditions
alpha <- 0.02 # Temperature coefficient
beta <- 0.01 # Humidity coefficient
T0 <- 25 # Reference temperature °C
H0 <- 60 # Reference humidity %
C0 <- 100 # Initial drug concentration (% of original potency)

# Calculating rate constant k for each simulation
k <- k0 * (1 + alpha * (temperatures - T0) + beta * (humidity - H0))

hist(k)

# Calculating remaining potency after 12 months
time <- 12 # months
C_t <- C0 * exp(-k * time)
hist(C_t, main = "Histogram of remaining potency after 12 months", xlab = "Potency (%)", col = "steelblue")
mean(C_t)

# Assessing shelf life based on criterion of at least 90% remaining potency
shelf_life_criteria <- sum(C_t >= 90) / n_simulations * 100

# Printing the result
cat("Percentage of simulations with at least 90% potency after 12 months:", shelf_life_criteria, "%\n")
